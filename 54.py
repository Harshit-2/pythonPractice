print(a is b)  # exact location of object in memory
print(a is None)  # exact location of object in memory
print(a == b)  # value


#   â˜… Clink: In case of a = 3 b = 3 is returned true because both a and b were pointing to the same location as both are constants and can't be changed, so python created them in the same memory location same goes for a = "Japan" b = "Japan", a = (1, 2) b = (1, 2) & a = None b = None
