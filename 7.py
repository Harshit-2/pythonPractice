# Exercise 1 --> Create a calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on two numbers. Your program should format the output in a readable manner!

x = 23
y = 10

print("Addition of", x, "and", y, "returns =>", (x + y))
print("Subtraction of", x, "and", y, "returns =>", (x - y))
print("Multiplication of", x, "and", y, "returns =>", (x * y))
print("Division of", x, "and", y, "returns =>", (x / y))
